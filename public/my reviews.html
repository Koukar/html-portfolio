 <h1>The best Horror movies according to Khouloud</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all the time</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h2>Silent Hill</h2>
 <p>look more like an experimental art film than a horror film </p>
 <h2>US</h2>
 <p>Every image seems to be a clue for whats about to happen or a stand-in for something outside the main story of a family in danger</p>
 <h2>The conjuring</h2>
 <p>My favourite of all the time . super scary</p>
